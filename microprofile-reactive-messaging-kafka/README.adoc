:technologies: MicroProfile Reactive Messaging

[abstract]
The `microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka` quickstart demonstrates the use of the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification backed by Apache Kafka in {productName}.

== What is it?

link:https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging] is a framework for building event-driven, data streaming, and event-sourcing applications using CDI. It lets your application interact using messaging technologies such as link:https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka].

The implementation of MicroProfile Reactive Messaging is built on top of link:https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-streams[MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators]. Reactive Streams Operators extends the link:https://www.reactive-streams.org[Reactive Streams] specification, by adding operators such as `map()`, `filter()` and others.

== Architecture

In this quickstart, we have a CDI bean that demonstrates the functionality of the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification. Currently, we support Reactive Messaging 1.0. Connections to external messaging systems such as Apache Kafka are configured via MicroProfile Config. We will also use Reactive Streams Operators to modify the data relayed in these streams in the methods handling the Reactive Messaging streams.

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions that
<<creating-new-project, create the application step by step>>. However, you can
also go right to the completed example which is available in this directory.

CAUTION: Kafka must be running before attempting to deploy the Quickstart application. See <<running-the-apache-kafka-service,Running the Apache Kafka Service>> for how to do this in your local environment.

== Creating the Maven Project

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DgroupId=org.wildfly.quickstarts \
    -DartifactId=microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
cd microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka
----

Open the project in your favourite IDE.

The project needs to be updated to use Java 8 as the minimum:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
<maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
<maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
----

Next set up our dependencies. Add the following section to your
`pom.xml`:

[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <!-- importing the jakartaee8-with-tools BOM adds specs and other useful artifacts as managed dependencies -->
    <dependency>

By using boms the majority of dependencies used within this quickstart align with the version used by the application server.

Now we need to add the dependencies which are needed by what is the focus of this QuickStart (CDI, MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, Reactive Streams Operators, Reactive Streams and the Apache Kafka Client). Additionally we need to add dependencies for 'supporting' functionality (JPA, JTA and JAX-RS):

All dependencies have the 'provided' scope.

As we are going to be deploying this application to the {productName} server, let's
also add a maven plugin that will simplify the deployment operations (you can replace
the generated build section):

// Setup required repositories
include::../shared-doc/setup-repositories.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

Now we are ready to start working with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging.

== Preparing the Application

This will walk you through the steps to write our application. They are:

* Create a generator for the generated messages. We will create something which mocks a call to an asynchnronous resource.
* Add a data object which wraps the generated messages and adds a timestamp. We will use JPA annotations on this to make it persistable.
* Create our CDI bean interfacing with the Kafka streams via annotated methods. For the streams that are managed by Kafka we will provide a MicroProfile Config file to configure how to interact with Kafka. It will log, filter and store entries to a RDBMS.
* Create a CDI bean that will be used to store and retrieve entries from a RDBMS.
* Create a JAX-RS endpoint to return the data that was stored in the RDBMS to the user.

=== Adding our Data Generator
Copy across the `microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka/src/main/java/org/wildfly/quickstarts/microprofile/reactive/messaging/MockExternalAsyncResource.java` file to your project. This class mocks a call to an asynchronous external resource. The details of how it is implemented are not important for this QuickStart.

`MockExternalAsyncResource` has one callable method:

[source,java]
----
public CompletionStage<String> getNextValue()
----

The `CompletionStage` returned by this method will complete with a String when ready. A String is ready every two seconds. It will emit the following Strings in the given order: 

* `Hello`
* `World`
* `Reactive`
* `Messaging`
* `with`
* `Kafka`

After this initial sequence the returned `CompletionStage` will complete with a random entry from the above list. A new entry is available every two seconds.

=== Adding a Data Object
Later we will wrap the strings in a `TimedEntry` object which contains the String and a timestamp. Since we will be storing it in a database, we add JPA annotations to it:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging;

import java.sql.Timestamp;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class TimedEntry {
    private Long id;
    private Timestamp time;
    private String message;

    public TimedEntry() {

    }

    public TimedEntry(Timestamp time, String message) {
        this.time = time;
        this.message = message;
    }

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public Timestamp getTime() {
        return time;
    }

    public void setTime(Timestamp time) {
        this.time = time;
    }

    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }

    public void setMessage(String message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        String s = "TimedEntry{";
        if (id != null) {
            s += "id=" + id + ", ";
        }
        s += "time=" + time +
                ", message='" + message + '\'' +
                '}';
        return s;
    }
}
----

=== Adding our Messaging CDI Bean

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging is based on CDI, so all interaction with the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging streams must happen from a CDI beans. **Note:** The beans must have either the `@ApplicationScoped` or `@Dependent` scopes.

Then within these beans we have a set of methods using the `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotations from the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification to map the underlying streams. For an `@Outgoing` annotation its `value` specifies the Reactive Messaging stream to send data to, and for an `@Incoming` annotation its `value` specifies the Reactive Messaging stream to read data from. Although in this QuickStart we are putting all these methods into one CDI bean class, they could be spread over several beans.

The MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification contains a full list of all the valid method signatures for such `@Incoming`/`@Outging` methods. We will use a few of them, and see how they make different use-cases easier.

Our bean looks as follows, and this is the main focus for the functionality in this QuickStart. We will also be using some other technologies, but they are secondary to this section. Explanations of each method will be given in line.

[source, java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging;

import java.sql.Timestamp;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.streams.operators.PublisherBuilder;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.streams.operators.ReactiveStreams;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;


@ApplicationScoped
public class MessagingBean {
----
First we inject our mock asynchronous external data producer, which produces a string every two seconds. We explained this class in a previous section.
[source, java]
----

    @Inject
    MockExternalAsyncResource producer;
----
We inject a bean that will be used to persist entries to a RDBMS later on.
[source, java]
----
    @Inject
    DatabaseBean dbBean;
----
Now we get to the reactive messaging part.

Our first method is a 'producer' method, since is annotated with the `@Outgoing` annotation. It simply relays the output of our mock producer bean to the reactive messaging system. It uses the channel `source` (as indicated in the `@Outgoing` annotation's value) as the target stream to send the data to. You can think of 'producer' methods as the entry point to push data into the reactive messaging streams.
[source, java]
----

    @Outgoing("source")
    public CompletionStage<String> sendInVm() {
        return producer.getNextValue();
    }
----
Next we have a 'processor' method. It is annotated with both `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotations so it gets data from the reactive messaging streams and then pushes it to another stream. Essentially it simply relays data.

In this case we get data from the `source` stream, so it will receive the entries made available by the `sendInVm()` method above, and forwards everything onto the `filter` stream.

In this case, since we just want to log the strings that were emitted, we are using a simple method signature receiving and returning the raw string provided. The Reactive Messaging implementation has unwrapped the `CompletionStage` from the previous method for us.

Note that there is no Kafka involved yet. Since the `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` values match up, Reactive Messaging will use internal, in-memory streams.
[source, java]
----
    @Incoming("source")
    @Outgoing("filter")
    public String logAllMessages(String message) {
        System.out.println("Received " + message);
        return message;
    }
----
Now we have another 'processor' method. We get the data from the `filter` stream (what was relayed by the previous `logAllMessages()` method) and forward it on to the `sender` stream.

In this method we want to do something a bit more advanced, namely apply a filter to the messages. We use a method receiving and returning a Reactive Stream, in this case we use `PublisherBuilder` from the MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators specification. `PublisherBuilder` extends the `Publisher` interface from the Reactive Streams specification, and provides us with the `filter()` methods we will use here.

Again the Reactive Messaging implementation does all the wrapping for us.

Our filter method tells us to only relay messages that match `Hello` or `Kafka`, and drop everything else. In other words, later methods in the stream will only receive occurrences of `Hello` or `Kafka`.

[source, java]
----
    @Incoming("filter")
    @Outgoing("sender")
    public PublisherBuilder<String> filter(PublisherBuilder<String> messages) {
        return messages
                .filter(s -> s.equals("Hello") || s.equals("Kafka"));
    }
----
Next we have another 'processor' method, which receives data from the `sender` stream and forwards it on to the `to-kafka` stream. It's parameter is a simple `String`, MicroProfile Reactive Messaging will unwrap the stream from the `PublisherBuilder` returned in the previous method and call this next method with the individual entries.

In this method we want to wrap up the data into the `TimedEntry` class we defined earlier, so we have tuple of the message and a timestamp.

Additionally we want to set a Kafka key for the entries so that we can take advantage of Kafka's querying capabilities (not done in this quickstart). In order to do this, we do the following steps:

* Create an instance of `Message` from the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API. A `Message` is a simple wrapper around the payload. In our case we use the `TimedEntry` instance we created.
* We create the key for the `TimedEntry`. In this case we just use a hash of the message.
* Use the `OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata` builder to create an instance of `OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata` with the key
* Next we call `KafkaMetadataUtil.writeOutgoingKafkaMetadata()` to augment the `Message` with the `OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata`. Note that the `Message` passed in to `KafkaMetadataUtil.writeOutgoingKafkaMetadata()` is not modified, we need the returned one.
* We return the augmented `Message` to the stream which is backed by Kafka

[source, java]
----
    @Incoming("sender")
    @Outgoing("to-kafka")
    public Message<TimedEntry> sendToKafka(String msg) {
        // Simpler example for debugging
        TimedEntry te = new TimedEntry(new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis()), msg);
        Message<TimedEntry> m = Message.of(te);
        // Just use the hash as the Kafka key for this example
        int key = te.getMessage().hashCode();

        // Create Metadata containing the Kafka key
        OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata<Integer> md = OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata
                .<Integer>builder()
                .withKey(key)
                .build();

        // The returned message will have the metadata added
        return KafkaMetadataUtil.writeOutgoingKafkaMetadata(m, md);
    }
----
Our final method is a 'consumer' method, as it has only an `@Incoming` annotation. You can think of this as a 'final destination' for the data in your application. We are using a  `Message<TimedEntry>` as our method parameter. We are using this signature since we want to access the `IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata`, which contains the key we added in the previous method and additional information such as the Kafka partition and topic the message was sent on. Since we are using the signature taking a `Message` as the parameter, we need to `ack()` the message and return the resulting `CompletionStage<Void>`. (If we don't want to ack the receipt of the message and are not interested in the `IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata`, we could have used a simpler signature such as `void receiveFromKafka(TimedEntry message)`.)

The methid calls through to our `dbBean` to store the received data in a RDBMS. We will look at this briefly later.
[source, java]
----
    @Incoming("from-kafka")
    public CompletionStage<Void> receiveFromKafka(Message<TimedEntry> message) {
        TimedEntry payload = message.getPayload();

        IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata<Integer, TimedEntry> md =
            KafkaMetadataUtil.readIncomingKafkaMetadata(message).get();
        String msg =
                "Received from Kafka, storing it in database\n" +
                "\t%s\n" +
                "\tkey: %d; partition: %d, topic: %s";
        msg = String.format(msg, payload, md.getKey(), md.getPartition(), md.getTopic());
        System.out.println(msg);
        dbBean.store(payload);
        return message.ack();
    }} // MessagingBean - END
----
You might have noticed that up to, and including, the `sendToKafka()` method the `@Incoming.value()` matches the `@Outgoing.value()` of the prior method. This indicates that these streams (`source`, `filter` and `sender`) are handled in memory by the Reactive Messaging implementation.

For the last two methods this is different and there is no such pairing. The `sendToKafka()` method sends its data to the `to-kafka` stream:
[source, java]
----
    ...
    @Outgoing("to-kafka")
    public Publisher<TimedEntry> sendToKafka(Publisher<String> messages) {
       ...
    }
----
However, there are no methods annotated with `@Incoming("to-kafka)`.

And the `receiveFromKafka()` method is expecting to receive data from the `from-kafka` stream:
[source, java]
----
    @Incoming("from-kafka")
    public void receiveFromKafka(TimedEntry message) {
       ...
    }
----
Again, there are no methods annotated with `@Outgoing("from-kafka")`.

These 'unpaired' sets of methods indicate that we do not want to use an in-memory stream, and want to use an external system for these streams. If we were try to deploy the MessagingBean in this state the application would fail to deploy. To fix this, and tell it what to map onto, we need to provide some configuration.

NOTE: `IncomingKafkaRecordMetadata` is only available on incoming streams coming from Kafka. `OutgoingKafkaRecordMetadata` will only have effect on outgoing streams going to Kafka.

==== Mapping Streams to Kafka using MicroProfile Config
To map 'unpaired' streams onto Kafka we need to add a MicroProfile Config file to configure these streams.

Create a file called `src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` and add the following:

[source,properties]
----
mp.messaging.connector.smallrye-kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092

mp.messaging.outgoing.to-kafka.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.to-kafka.topic=testing
mp.messaging.outgoing.to-kafka.key.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerSerializer
mp.messaging.outgoing.to-kafka.value.serializer=org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging.TimedEntrySerializer

# Configure the Kafka source (we read from it)
mp.messaging.incoming.from-kafka.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.from-kafka.topic=testing
mp.messaging.incoming.from-kafka.value.deserializer=org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging.TimedEntryDeserializer
mp.messaging.incoming.from-kafka.key.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerDeserializer
----

The MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification mandates the following pre-fixes:

* `mp.messaging.connector.` - used to set overall configuration for your application.
* `mp.messaging.outgoing.` - used to configure streams we are writing to from methods annotated with `@Outgoing`. The next element determines the name of the stream as identified in the `@Outgoing` annotation so all the properties starting with `mp.messaging.outgoing.to-kafka` are used to configure the writing done by the `sendToKafka()` method which is annotated with `@Outgoing("to-kafka")`.
* `mp.messaging.incoming.` - used to configure streams we are reading from in methods annotated with `@Incoming`. The next element determines the name of the stream as identified in the `@Incoming` annotation so all the properties starting with `mp.messaging.incoming.from-kafka` are used to configure the reading done by the `receiveFromKafka()` method which is annotated with `@Incoming("from-kafka")`.

What comes after these prefixes is vendor dependent. We use the SmallRye implementation of MicroProfile Reactive Messaging.

At the application level, the `mp.messaging.connector.smallrye-kafka.bootstrap.servers` property says that all conections to Kafka in this application should go to `localhost:9092`. This is not strictly necessary, since this value is the default that would be used if not specified. If we wanted to override this for say the `@Outgoing("to-kafka")` annotated `sendToKafka()` method we could specify this with a property such as:

[source, properties]
----
mp.messaging.outgoing.to-kafka.bootstrap.servers=otherhost:9092
----

For the incoming and outgoing properties we can see that they all specify that they should use the `smallrye-kafka` connector and that the outgoing one writes to the same topic, `testing`, as the incoming one reads from.

We see that the outgoing configuration uses a `TimedEntrySerializer` while the incoming one uses `TimedEntryDeserializer` for the values. Kafka just deals with byte streams, so we need to tell it how to serialize the data we are sending and how to deserialize the data we are receiving. As seen is configured with properties of the form `mp.messaging.outgoing.<stream name>.value.serializer` and `mp.messaging.incoming.<stream name>.value.deserializer`. The link:https://kafka.apache.org/27/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/common/serialization/package-summary.html[org.apache.kafka.common.serialization] package contains implementations of serializers and deserializers for simple data types and constructs such as maps.

Finally, since the Kafka key is an `Integer`, we use `IntegerSerializer` and `IntegerDeserializer` for the keys. The concept is exactly the same as for the value (de)serializers, but is instead configured with the properties `mp.messaging.outgoing.<stream name>.key.serializer` and `mp.messaging.incoming.<stream name>.key.deserializer`.


===== Custom (De)Serializers
In our case the data we are sending to and receiving from Kafka is not a simple object. It is an object of a class defined in our application, so we need to define our own serialization and deserialization. Luckily, this is easy. We just need to implement the link:https://kafka.apache.org/27/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/common/serialization/Serializer.html[org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer] and link:https://kafka.apache.org/27/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/common/serialization/Deserializer.html[org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer] interfaces.

Here is our `TimedEntrySerializer`:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging;

import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;

import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer;

public class TimedEntrySerializer implements Serializer<TimedEntry> {
    @Override
    public byte[] serialize(String topic, TimedEntry data) {
        if (data == null) {
            return null;
        }

        try {
            ByteArrayOutputStream bout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
            ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(bout);
            out.writeLong(data.getTime().getTime());
            out.writeUTF(data.getMessage());
            out.close();
            return bout.toByteArray();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }

    }
}
----

And here is our `TimedEntryDeserializer`:

import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.sql.Timestamp;

import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Deserializer;

public class TimedEntryDeserializer implements Deserializer<TimedEntry> {

    @Override
    public TimedEntry deserialize(String topic, byte[] data) {
        if (data == null) {
            return null;
        }
        try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data))){
            Timestamp time = new Timestamp(in.readLong());
            String message = in.readUTF();
            return new TimedEntry(time, message);
        } catch (IOException e){
            e.printStackTrace();
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
----

As you can see the serializer writes the time as a Long, and the message as a string, and the deserializer reads them in the same order. Then in our `microprofile-config.properties` above we saw how to make Kafka use our classes for serialization and deserialization.

### Storing Data in an RDBMS
We have covered all the reactive messaging parts, but have missed out how the `MessagingBean.receiveFromKafka()` stores data via the `DatabaseBean`. This is not the focus of this QuickStart, so we will just mention how this works quickly.

This is the definition of `DatabaseBean`:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging;

import java.util.List;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;
import javax.persistence.TypedQuery;
import javax.transaction.Transactional;

@ApplicationScoped
public class DatabaseBean {

    @PersistenceContext(unitName = "test")
    EntityManager em;

    @Transactional
    public void store(Object entry) {
        em.persist(entry);
    }

    public List<TimedEntry> loadAllTimedEntries() {
        TypedQuery<TimedEntry> query = em.createQuery("SELECT t from TimedEntry t", TimedEntry.class);
        List<TimedEntry> result = query.getResultList();
        return result;
    }
}
----
It injects an `EntityManager` for the persitence context `test`, which is defined in the `src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml` file:
[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence version="2.2"
             xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_2.xsd">
    <persistence-unit name="test">
        <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/ExampleDS</jta-data-source>
        <properties>
            <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="create-drop"/>
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
----
The `DatabaseBean.store()` method saves the `TimedEntry` and the `DatabaseBean.loadAllTimedEntries()` method loads all the ones we stored.

It is worth pointing out that the `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotated methods called by the Reactive Messaging implementation (such as `MessagingBean.receiveFromKafka()`) happen outside of user space, so there is no @Transaction associated with them. So we need to annotated the `DatabaseBean.store()` method with `@Transactional` in order to save our entry to the database.

### Viewing the Data Stored in the RDBMS
Finally, we would like to be able to view the data that was stored in the database. To do this we will add a JAX-RS endpoint that queries the database by calling `DatabaseBean.loadAllTimedEntries()`.

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging;

import java.util.List;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/")
public class RootResource {

    @Inject
    DatabaseBean dbBean;

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String getRootResponse() {
        List<TimedEntry> entries = dbBean.loadAllTimedEntries();
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
        for (TimedEntry t : entries) {
            sb.append(t);
            sb.append("\n");
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

----
We expose our JAX-RS application at the context path:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging;

import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/")
public class JaxRsApplication extends Application {
}

----

### Interaction with User Initiated Code
So far what we have seen is really happening in the back-end with little user interaction.
The MicroProfile Reactive Messaging 2.0 specification adds a `@Channel` annotation and an `Emitter` interface which makes it easier to send data to MicroProfile Reactive Messaging streams from user initiated code and to receive data from Reactive Messaging streams.

To showcase this functionality we add another CDI bean called `UserMessagingBean`:
[source, java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging;

import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArraySet;

import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.FormParam;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;
import org.reactivestreams.Subscriber;
import org.reactivestreams.Subscription;

@ApplicationScoped
public class UserMessagingBean {

    @Inject
    @Channel("user")
    private Emitter<String> emitter;

    private BroadcastPublisher<String> broadcastPublisher;

    public UserMessagingBean() {
        //Needed for CDI spec compliance
        //The @Inject annotated one will be used
    }

    @Inject
    public UserMessagingBean(@Channel("user") Publisher<String> receiver) {
        this.broadcastPublisher = new BroadcastPublisher(receiver);
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void destroy() {
        broadcastPublisher.close();
    }

    public Response send(String value) {
        System.out.println("Sending " + value);
        emitter.send(value);
        return Response.accepted().build();
    }

    public Publisher<String> getPublisher() {
        return broadcastPublisher;
    }

    private class BroadcastPublisher<T> implements Publisher<T> {
        // See source code for more details
    }
}
----

Looking at this in more detail, the following field
[source, java]
----
    @Inject
    @Channel("user")
    private Emitter<String> emitter;
----
is used to send data to the MicroProfile Reactive Messagin stream called `user`, which is done in the following method
[source, java]
----
    public Response send(String value) {
        System.out.println("Sending " + value);
        emitter.send(value);
        return Response.accepted().build();
    }
----

`@Inject @Channel` on an `Emitter` can be considered similiar to an `@Outgoing` annotated method but with the data coming from code paths invoked by user interaction. In this case we are not using Kafka to back the stream but if we wanted to, for this example, the MicroProfile Config properties would be prefixed with the `mp.messaging.outgoing.user.` prefix.

Next we have the constructor where we inject a `Publisher` (We could also have used a MicroProfile Reactive Streams Operators `PublisherBuiilder`) to define the receiving side.

[source, java]
----
    @Inject
    public UserMessagingBean(@Channel("user") Publisher<String> receiver) {
        this.broadcastPublisher = new BroadcastPublisher(receiver);
    }
----
We store this injected `Publisher` in the `broadcastPublisher` field. We will come back to why we are wrapping it in a `BroadcastPublisher` in a second.  So an `@Inject @Channel` on a `Publisher` (or `PublisherBuilder`) can be considered equivalent to use of the `@Incoming` annotation. In this case we are listening to the `user` in memory stream so messages sent via the `Emitter` will be received on this `Publisher`. If instead we wanted to configure it to send via Kafka we would use MicroProfile Config properties prefixed with the `mp.messaging.incoming.user.` prefix.

There are a few caveats on this mechanism though:

1. There must be an active `Subscription` (from the Reactive Streams specification) on the channel before the `Emitter.send()` method is called.
2. There can only be one `Subscription` on the injected `Publisher`. This means that we cannot simply return this `Publisher` as is via an asynchronous JAX-RS endpoint as each client request would result in a separate `Subscription`.

The above two points will hopefully be fixed in a future version of the specification. For the purposes of this quickstart we are bypassing the above limitations by creating the `BroadcastPublisher` class and wrapping the original `Publisher` in that instead. Note that implementing `Publisher` is hard, and that `BroadcastPublisher` should be considered a 'proof of concept'. For more details about the `BroadcastPublisher` see the source code of the `UserMessagingBean` class. In a nutshell what it does is:

* Its constructor subscribes to the injected `Publisher` to avoid the first problem
* When code subscribes to it, it handles the `Subscription` on its own level, and forwards on code received on the ' a separate level and forwards on data received from the base `Subsciption` created in the constructor.

Finally we have a JAX-RS endpoint
[source, java]
----
package org.wildfly.quickstarts.microprofile.reactive.messaging;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.POST;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.Stream;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

@ApplicationScoped
@Path("/user")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
public class UserResource {
    @Inject
    UserMessagingBean bean;

    @POST
    @Path("{value}")
    @Consumes(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public Response send(@PathParam("value") String value) {
        bean.send(value);
        return Response.ok().build();
    }

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
    @Stream
    public Publisher<String> get() {
        return bean.getPublisher();
    }
}
----
It simply delegates the values received from `POST` requests under `/user/<value>` onto the bean which sends them via the `Emitter`.

Then `GET` requests for `/user` return the `BroadCastPublisher` to the user who will then receive data received on the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging channel.

---

Now you should be able to compile the application and prepare it for deployment.



=== Running the Application on a Standalone {productName} Server

We need to first start Apache Kafka. Then we will run the {productName} server and deploy our application to the server.


[[running-the-apache-kafka-service]]
== Running the Apache Kafka Service

To run the Apache Kafka service we will use its Docker container. Note that this also requires Apache Zookeeper, so rather than a simple `docker run` command this quickstart directory contains a `docker-compose.yaml` file defining the two Docker containers needed. The
file can be found link:./docker-compose.yaml[here].

NOTE: If you don't have Docker installed on your machine please follow the
instructions at https://www.docker.com/get-started.

Run the following command from this folder:

[source]
----
docker-compose up
----

NOTE: This can take a minute.

== Build and Deploy the Initial Application
Let's check that our application works!

. Make sure xref:start_the_eap_standalone_server[the {productName} server is started] as described above.
. {productName} ships with all the modules to run MicroProfile Reactive Messaging applications with Kafka, but the functionality is not enabled out of the box, so we need to enable it. Run: `$ __{jbossHomeName}__/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=enable-reactive-messaging.cli` to set everything up. The `enable-reactive-messaging.cli` file used can be found link:enable-reactive-messaging.cli[here].
. Open new terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
. Type the following command to build and deploy the project:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

Now we should see output in the server console. First, we see output for the ones in the determined order:
[source, options="nowrap"]
----
14:24:39,197 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) Received from Kafka, storing it in database
14:24:39,197 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) 	TimedEntry{time=2021-08-06 14:24:39.183, message='Hello'}
14:24:39,197 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) 	key: 69609650; partition: 0, topic: testing

14:24:49,188 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) 	TimedEntry{time=2021-08-06 14:24:49.183, message='Kafka'}

14:24:51,184 INFO  [stdout] (pool-22-thread-1) Received Kafka
----
Then we get another section where it is using the randomised order
[source, options="nowrap"]
----
14:24:51,184 INFO  [stdout] (pool-22-thread-1) Received Kafka
14:24:51,190 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) Received from Kafka, storing it in database

14:24:51,190 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) 	key: 72255238; partition: 0, topic: testing
14:24:53,184 INFO  [stdout] (pool-22-thread-1) Received world
14:24:55,184 INFO  [stdout] (pool-22-thread-1) Received world
14:24:57,184 INFO  [stdout] (pool-22-thread-1) Received Reactive
14:24:59,181 INFO  [stdout] (pool-22-thread-1) Received Hello
14:24:59,187 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) Received from Kafka, storing it in database
14:24:59,187 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) 	TimedEntry{time=2021-08-06 14:24:59.182, message='Hello'}
14:24:59,187 INFO  [stdout] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) 	key: 69609650; partition: 0, topic: testing
----

In both parts of the log we see that all messages reach the `logAllMessages()` method, while only `Hello` and `Kafka` reach the `receiveFromKafka()` method which saves them to the RDBMS.

To inspect what was stored in the database, go to http://localhost:8080/microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka in  your browser and you should see something like:

[source, options="nowrap"]
----
TimedEntry{id=1, time=2021-08-06 14:24:39.183, message='Hello'}
TimedEntry{id=2, time=2021-08-06 14:24:49.183, message='Kafka'}
TimedEntry{id=3, time=2021-08-06 14:24:51.184, message='Kafka'}
TimedEntry{id=4, time=2021-08-06 14:24:59.182, message='Hello'}
----
The timestamps of the entries in the browser match the ones we saw in the server logs.

=== Interaction with User Initiated Code
With the application still running, open two terminal windows. Enter the following `curl` command in both of them
```
$curl -N http://localhost:8080/microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka/user
```
The `-N` option keeps the connection open, so we receive data as it becomes available on the publisher.

In a third terminal window enter the commands:
```
$curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka/user/one
$curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka/user/two
$curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka/user/three
```
In the first two terminal windows you should see these entries appear as they are posted:
```
data: one

data: two

data: three
```

== Deploy the {ProductShortName} Source-to-Image (S2I) Quickstart to OpenShift
The sub-sections describe how to deploy the application to OpenShift interacting with Kafka provided by either:

* <<xp-deploy-project-amq-streams,AMQ Streams>>
* <<xp-deploy-project-rhosak,RHOSAK>>

NOTE: For the purposes of this Quickstart, you should choose one of these approaches, not both. Your choice should match the type of Kafka instance you selected earlier in <<installing-kafka-on-openshift, Installing Kafka on OpenShift>>.

In both cases we will use Helm to install the application. Make sure you have downloaded the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/applications/working_with_helm_charts/installing-helm.html[Helm CLI Tool].

[[xp-deploy-project-amq-streams]]
=== Deploy the {ProductShortName} Source-to-Image (S2I) Quickstart to OpenShift with AMQ Streams
This section describes how to deploy the application to OpenShift interacting with Kafka provided by AMQ Streams. If you want to use RHOSAK instead, see the <<xp-deploy-project-rhosak,RHOSAK instructions>>.

First add the Helm repository, if you have not done so already, as described in {helmRepoUrl}.

Then run the following command to deploy and start the application (note we are using the name `mp-rm-qs` for our application here):

[source,subs="attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
helm install mp-rm-qs -f ./helm-amq-streams.yml {helmChartName} --set build.ref={WildFlyQuickStartRepoTag}
----

NOTE: Although the above command will return quite quickly, it will take a while until the application pod is actually brought up. In the OpenShift console you will see a pod whose name starts with mp-rm-qs in the `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackoff` state until the build has completed.

The contents of the link:helm-amq-streams.yml[`helm-amq-streams.yml`] file specify:

* The Galleon layers to use when creating the server under `build/s2i/galleonLayers`
** `microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka` contains the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging with Kafka functionality
** `h2-default-datasource` enables the HSQL database we store data in
** `cloud-server` provides among other things the web server functionality
* For both the build (under `build/env`) and the deploy `deploy/env`) parts, we specify environment variables to increase some JVM arguments from the default.

Run `oc get route` to find the URL of our application.

[[xp-deploy-project-rhosak]]
=== Deploy the {ProductShortName} Source-to-Image (S2I) Quickstart to OpenShift with RHOSAK
This section describes how to deploy the application to OpenShift interacting with Kafka provided by RHOSAK. If you want to use AMQ Streams instead, see the <<xp-deploy-project-amq-streams,AMQ Streams instructions>>.

To deploy your application make sure you have downloaded the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/applications/working_with_helm_charts/installing-helm.html[Helm CLI Tool]. `./helm-rhosak.yml` contains the information to deploy the application to be backed by Kafka provided by RHOSAK.

First add the Helm repository, if you have not done so already, as described in {helmRepoUrl}.

Then run the following command to deploy and start the application (note we are using the name `mp-rm-qs` for our application here, as mentioned when we connected RHOSAK to our OpenShift project):
[source,subs="attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
helm install mp-rm-qs -f ./helm-rhosak.yml {helmChartName} --set build.ref={WildFlyQuickStartRepoTag}
----
NOTE: Although the above command will return quite quickly, it will take a while until the application pod is actually brought up. In the OpenShift console you will see a pod whose name starts with mp-rm-qs in the `ErrImagePull` or `ImagePullBackoff` state until the build has completed.

While the OpenShift cluster is doing the work to build and deploy the application (i.e. as soon as the `helm install` has completed in your terminal), run the following command to set up the service binding for the Kafka connection as mentioned earlier:
[source,subs="attributes+",options="nowrap"]
----
rhoas cluster bind --app-name mp-rm-qs --service-type kafka --binding-name kafka-config --yes
----

You may also wait performing the above command until the application pod has been brought up. In this case it will log errors that it is not able to connect to Kafka. Once the above command is run, the 'faulty' pod will be taken down and replaced by one containing the correct configuration.

The contents of the link:helm-rhosak.yml[`helm-rhosak.yml`] file:

* Specify the Galleon layers to use when creating the server under `build/s2i/galleonLayers`
** `microprofile-reactive-messaging-kafka` contains the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging with Kafka functionality
** `h2-default-datasource` enables the HSQL database we store data in
** `cloud-server` provides among other things the web server functionality.
* For both the build (under `build/env`) and the deploy `deploy/env`) parts, we specify environment variables to increase some JVM arguments from the default.
* Additionally, under `build/env` we set `QS_USE_RHOSAK` to `1` which makes the script in link:src/main/scripts/rhosak/s2i/install.sh[`src/main/scripts/rhosak/s2i/install.sh`] copy the contents of the directory, which in turn runs the link:[`src/main/scripts/rhosak/s2i/initialize-server.cli`] CLI script to enable the service binding and points relevant MicroProfile Config properties to the service binding via the `microprofile-config-smallrye` subsystem.

Run `oc get route` find the URL of our application.

== Conclusion

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging and Reactive Streams Operators allow you to publish to, process and consume streams, optionally backed by Kafka, by adding `@Incoming` and `@Outgoing` annotations to your methods. 'Paired' streams work in memory. To map 'un-paired' streams to be backed by Kafka you need to provide configuration via MicroProfile Config.
